It is basic implementation of unit of work pattern.
1. If you need proper implementation for roll back, shallow copy concept has to be considered for keeping the copy of
   persisted domain object, when roll back is done, previous copy of object is restored.
2. If you need to keep record of dependencies (one to one, one to many, many to many) then which object is supposed to
   persisted before has to be taken care.

This is why we develop custom unit of work, on ORM tool.
