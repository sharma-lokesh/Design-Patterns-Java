The Facade design pattern is often used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand
because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is
unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler
interface to the client. It typically involves a single wrapper class which contains a set of
members required by client. These members access the system on behalf of the facade client and
hide the implementation details.

According to GoF Facade design pattern is:

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
Facade Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
