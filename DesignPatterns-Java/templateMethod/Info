Template method is using as an inverted controls structure, sometimes referred as “the Hollywood principle”: 
from the superclass point of view: “Don't call us, we'll call you”. This refers to the fact that instead of calling 
the methods from base class in the subclasses, the methods from subclass are called in the template method from 
superclass.
Due to the above fact a special care should be paid to the access modifiers: the template method should be 
implemented only in the base class, and the primitive method should be implemented in the subclasses. 
A particular case of the template method is represented by the customization hooks.
