AbstractFactory class declares only an interface for creating the products. 
The actual creation is the task of the ConcreteProduct classes, where a good approach is applying the 
Factory Method design pattern for each product of the family.


Extending factories can be done by using one Create method for all products and attaching information 
about the type of product needed.

It is factory of factories, and generally used when there is more than one product involved.
